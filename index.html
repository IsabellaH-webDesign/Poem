        <h1>Life of a Star</h1>
        
        <p>Their talent is shown for the world to see <br> 
            For people they strive to please <br> 
            A life of <em>fame</em> and <em>fortune</em> <br> 
            Yet one misstep, it's <strong>misfortune</strong> <br> Hard work and dedication, <br> 
            to keep the reputation <br> 
            <strong>Pain</strong> they will never see, <br> 
            and a life which will <strong>never</strong> be free <br> 
            Smiling for the cameras <br> 
            <strong>Forever</strong> in the public eye</p>
